This code was created when I was really interested in numerology. 

This code takes password and calculates summary of corresponding numbers. Main idea is calculating together each number in resulting integer until there is one number., i.e., 25 will be 7; 31 will be 4; 81 will be 9 etc.

Lucky numbers are considered 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 9
